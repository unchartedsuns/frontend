                Uncharted Suns – or UcS – is an open source science fiction series where you – the members – get an
                opportunity to create star nations, corporations, organizations, and characters in the universe.
                There are many ways to take part in US. You can also write your own stories, but most people are
                going to get their start in US building their own group within the verse. We’ll assume you have
                created an account, but if you haven’t, click the “Login” button in the upper right-hand corner
                and create an account!

            <p>
                Before adding content of your own, it’s a good idea to peruse preexisting articles, such as the
                timeline, communications, and a few star-nation pages to get a feel for the universe. Your best
                source of information will often be other members, so feel free to ask questions in the forum or

            <h2>Adding to the 'Verse</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                Once you’ve learned a little about the US universe, feel free to add content. Just make sure to keep
                it within the constraints of the universe’s technology and lore-friendly realism, and new users are
                limited to only one “sphere of influence,” as explained in the “How to Make a Star Nation” page. Feel
                free to add as many corporations, factions, characters, starships, or whatever you need to help
                expose your ideas to everyone else or give background for a story or roleplay.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                If you think your content needs improvement, just ask the founder, crew members, or another member
                for assistance.

            <h2>Becoming Canon</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                Once you are satisfied with your content, it’s time to make it canon. Becoming canon is the highest
                honor your content can get in US. It becomes part of the permanent lore of the universe and will
                find its way into other player’s stories, creations, and games. To learn more about this process,
                read the “becoming canon” section of our “how to.”
